Todo : 

1. Add the UUID ID to each shapes objects and store them as key, value (map based).

2. Add the Eraser functionality, Make sure to implement the Robust Hit Detection for the eraser instead of bounding box hit detection method.

3. Change the hit detection for the selection, moving, resizing of shapes, check isPointinPath(), ispointinStroke().

4.
